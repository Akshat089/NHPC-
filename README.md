# ‚ö° NHPC ‚Äî Next-Generation Hybrid Parallel Communication

## üß† Project Overview

**NHPC** (Next-Generation Hybrid Parallel Communication) is a high-performance computing runtime that integrates **MPI** and **NCCL** to enable efficient hybrid communication for distributed deep-learning workloads.  
This project explores combining traditional **CPU-based communication (MPI)** with **GPU-based collectives (NCCL)** for improved **overlap** and **performance**.
